This repository deals with the issue of constructing a pddl action model out of AI agents videos,
such that we can determine which fluent is holding in the current state via using image and object classifiers
on the videos's frames, to feed the resulting action model with legality of performing actions and the 
result of applying them, so we can imporve the action model in case we have a partial one. (( I need to write down this 
explanation better ))

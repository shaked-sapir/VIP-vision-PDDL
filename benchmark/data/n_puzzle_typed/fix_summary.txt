WHAT WAS FIXED:
---------------
For each step in the trajectory:
1. Examined the current_state to find which tile was actually at the "from" position
2. Updated the ground_action in the JSON file to use the correct tile
3. Updated the corresponding operator in the .trajectory file (without type annotations)

VERIFICATION (problem8 example):
--------------------------------
Step 1 - BEFORE: move(t_1:tile, p_3_2:position, p_4_2:position)
         AFTER:  move(t_18:tile, p_3_2:position, p_4_2:position)
         Current state had: at(t_18:tile, p_3_2:position) ✓

Step 2 - BEFORE: move(t_1:tile, p_3_3:position, p_3_2:position)
         AFTER:  move(t_10:tile, p_3_3:position, p_3_2:position)
         Current state had: at(t_10:tile, p_3_3:position) ✓

All corrections verified to match the actual state of the puzzle.

Excellent — this is thesis-grade material, and you’re absolutely right to formalize it properly.
Below is a clean, formal definition + proposition + proof, written in a style that fits an automated-planning / action-model-learning thesis.

I’ll keep it self-contained, precise, and assumption-explicit, so you can drop it almost verbatim into your document.

Frame Axiom Relevance and Violation

Preliminaries

Let:
	•	\mathcal{O} be a finite set of objects.
	•	\mathcal{P} be a set of predicate symbols with fixed arities.
	•	A grounded predicate p is an expression P(o_1,\dots,o_k), where P \in \mathcal{P} and o_i \in \mathcal{O}.
	•	\text{objs}(p) = \{o_1,\dots,o_k\} denote the objects appearing in p.
	•	A grounded action a is an instantiation of an action schema with parameters \text{objs}(a) \subseteq \mathcal{O}.
	•	A transition is a tuple (s,a,s'), where s,s' are states represented as sets of positive grounded predicates.

We assume standard STRIPS semantics with no conditional effects.

⸻

Definition 1 (Action Relevance of a Predicate)

A grounded predicate p is relevant to a grounded action a iff:

\text{objs}(p) \subseteq \text{objs}(a)

If this condition does not hold, p is said to be frame-relevant (i.e., governed by the frame axiom) with respect to a.

⸻

Definition 2 (Frame Axiom)

Let (s,a,s') be a transition.
The frame axiom requires that for every grounded predicate p:

\bigl(\text{objs}(p) \nsubseteq \text{objs}(a)\bigr)
\;\;\Rightarrow\;\;
\bigl(p \in s \iff p \in s'\bigr)

That is, predicates whose objects are not fully bound by the action must persist unchanged across the transition.

⸻

Definition 3 (Frame Axiom Violation)

A frame axiom violation occurs in a transition (s,a,s') for a grounded predicate p iff:
	1.	p changes truth value between s and s', i.e.
(p \in s \;\wedge\; p \notin s') \;\;\text{or}\;\; (p \notin s \;\wedge\; p \in s')
	2.	\text{objs}(p) \neq \varnothing
	3.	\text{objs}(p) \nsubseteq \text{objs}(a)

⸻

Proposition 1 (Soundness of the Subset Relevance Criterion)

Let (s,a,s') be a transition generated by a STRIPS action model without conditional effects.
If a grounded predicate p satisfies:

\text{objs}(p) \nsubseteq \text{objs}(a)

then no valid action model consistent with STRIPS semantics can justify a change in the truth value of p across (s,a,s').

⸻

Proof

We prove by contradiction.

Assume that:
	1.	\text{objs}(p) \nsubseteq \text{objs}(a)
	2.	p changes truth value between s and s'
	3.	This change is caused by the execution of action a

Under STRIPS semantics:
	•	All effects of an action must be grounded instances of lifted effect literals in the action schema.
	•	Every lifted effect literal references only the action’s parameters.

Therefore, any grounded effect literal p produced by action a must satisfy:

\text{objs}(p) \subseteq \text{objs}(a)

This contradicts assumption (1).
Hence, no valid STRIPS action model can produce a change in p under action a.

Therefore, any observed change in such a predicate constitutes a violation of the frame axiom. ∎

⸻

Proposition 2 (Completeness of Frame-Axiom Violation Detection)

Let (s,a,s') be an observed transition.
If a predicate p changes truth value between s and s' and \text{objs}(p) \nsubseteq \text{objs}(a), then any action model consistent with the observations must either:
	1.	Repair the trajectory data (e.g., via fluent-level patches), or
	2.	Reject the transition as inconsistent with STRIPS semantics.

⸻

Proof Sketch

By Proposition 1, no STRIPS-consistent action model can explain the change as an effect of a.
Thus, to restore consistency, the learner must modify the data (repair) or discard the transition.
No alternative model-level explanation exists. ∎

⸻

Discussion and Implications
	•	The subset-based relevance criterion is strictly stronger than intersection-based heuristics.
	•	It prevents false negatives where a predicate shares some objects with an action but is not fully bound.
	•	It aligns exactly with lifted STRIPS semantics and parameter grounding.
	•	It enables sound frame-closure preprocessing, reducing the burden on conflict-based search.

⸻
\mathrm{objs}(p) \nsubseteq \mathrm{objs}(a)

When This Is Valid (Assumptions)

This reasoning holds under the following conditions:
	1.	Classical STRIPS semantics
	2.	No conditional effects
	3.	Fully grounded observations
	4.	Deterministic actions

If conditional effects or exogenous events are allowed, the proposition does not hold without modification.
